# Introduction

`Demo Container` is a `Vuepress-based` plug-in, which can help you add `Vue` examples when writing documents. Its original intention is to reduce the difficulty of adding some related examples when writing component documents.

::: warning Using Vuepress to write component examples has the following embarrassment:
Component examples and sample code are essentially the same, but need to be written twice;

Vuepress cannot render multiple `export default {}` code blocks in Markdown;
:::

The Demo Container refers to Element UI's document rendering and implements the same syntax as it can be used to write sample syntax directly in Markdown.

- Element UI ColorPicker component **documentation example**,[click here to view](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element/blob/dev/examples/docs/en-US/color-picker.md)
- Element UI ColorPicker component **document sample preview**,[click here to view](https://element.eleme.cn/2.0/#/en-US/component/color-picker)。

## How does it work?

The Demo Container uses Vuepress's [chainMarkdown, extendMarkdown API](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/option-api.html#extendmarkdown) to expand its internal markdown object and does the following:

1. Based on [markdown-it-container](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-container), a plug-in that recognizes the following code blocks is built

```
:::demo xxx
xxx
:::
```

Wrap the `<demo-block> </demo-block>` component for it, and pick up the sample code using `<!-Pre-render-demo: $ {content}: pre-render-demo->` comments Cache mode, wait for subsequent reading, specific implementation [click here to view](https://github.com/winyh/vuepress-plugin-block-winyh/blob/master/src/common/container.js);

2. Expand the markdown.render method, based on its rendering results, read the sample code annotated by `pre-render-demo` and use [vue-template-compiler](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler) compile it into a Redner Function and introduce it as a subcomponent of the entire sample page. The output of the expanded method is a code block that conforms to Vue Template syntax, specific implementation [click here to view](https://github.com/winyh/vuepress-plugin-block-winyh/blob/master/src/common/render.js);

3. The sample page code will be processed by [vue-loader](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/guide/) and compiled into the final document

## What is the rendering effect?

::: tip The following is an example of a component rendered using the Demo Container plugin
The display effect refers to the implementation of Element UI document component [demo-block.vue](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element/blob/dev/examples/components/demo-block.vue)
:::

::: demo This example refers to the [GitHub submission](https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/commits.html) implementation in the example of the `Vue` official document, uses the Github API to get the latest submission data of the repository, and displays them in a list.

## Why not...?

::: tip Are there any other options
Before I created the Demo Container, I searched for plug-ins that meet the above requirements as much as possible, and found some useful plugins. If there are other available plug-ins that have been omitted by the author, I can add it by mentioning [Issus](https://github.com/winyh/vuepress-plugin-block-winyh/issues). Thank you very much.

### vuepress-plugin-block-winyh

Repository [click here to view](https://github.com/xiguaxigua/vuepress-plugin-block-winyh),the **use of this plugin is exactly the same as the author's ideal way**, and its implementation principle is

Through [Vuepress clientRootMixin API](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/option-api.html#clientrootmixin) mixed into the mounted and updated life cycle of the page, read the sample code to separate the `template`,` script`, `style` code blocks:

- The code block wrapped by the template is inserted directly into the example node;
- The code block wrapped by script compiles the Vue object through Vue.extend, and then calls its \$ mount () method to mount it to the sample dom;
- The code block wrapped in style is inserted directly into the document;

The problem with this is that **template code blocks cannot contain globally registered components in Vuepress**, and writing component library examples will necessarily rely on globally registered components.

### vuepress-plugin-demo-code

Repository [click here to view](https://github.com/BuptStEve/vuepress-plugin-demo-code)，The plug-in's **use method is the same as the demo-block**. The workflow of the plugin is similar to the Demo Container. Its implementation principle is:

Extend the internal markdown object through [Vuepress extendMarkdown API](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/option-api.html#extendMarkdown), and then identify the `::: demo xxx :::` code block, and insert the wrapped sample code directly into the Markdown document to be processed by vue-loader.

The problem with this is that **only the `export default {}` block of the first example will be successfully recognized**, because vue-loader will only process the first match to the package when compiling a single file `<script> </script>` Code block.

### vuepress-plugin-extract-code

Repository [click here to view](https://github.com/vuepress-reco/vuepress-plugin-extract-code),The usage of this plugin is not consistent with the author's ideal way, but it **resolves the problem that component examples and code need to be written twice**, and its implementation principle is:

Provide a RecoDemo component for constructing sample pages in Markdown, and add a plug-in to Vuepress's internal markdown through [Vuepress chainMarkdown API](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/option-api.html#chainmarkdown). This plug-in is responsible for manually parsing `<<< @/docs/.vuepress/demo/demo.vue?template` syntax, identify the code block and add it to the sample code description, if you do n’t know the syntax, you can click [click here to view the description](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#%E5%AF%BC%E5%85%A5%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E6%AE%B5).

This takes advantage of the features of Vuepress's ability to compile Vue components, and there is no problem in use, but if a component usage document contains multiple examples, even if the single example code is very small, you have to create a file for it and register it globally. Vuepress, **The problem is troublesome maintenance**.
